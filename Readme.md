# Hubot-pair

This will help you pair with other developers making sure you're not
interrupting anybody.

## Hoe does it work?

As the person that is available to pair, you need to tell hubot you're
available for certain amount of time.

```shell
hubot pair me for 60min
hubot pair me forever # in case you're hard core in pairing
```

If you are the person looking for a pair, ask hubot for other people
availability.

```shell
hubot find me a pair
# > person1[15min], person2[30min], person3
```

If you end up pairing with somebody, let hubot know.

```shell
hubot im pairing with person1
```
